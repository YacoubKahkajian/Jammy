# Jammy
 A concept for competitive, gamified brainstorming.
 

## About
Jammy is a competitive, anonymous brainstorming utility which helps teams develop ideas for their next big projects in a fun and efficient way. Unlike other methods of brainstorming, such as whiteboarding or mind maps, where the empty canvas or dead discussion is a point of intimidation, Jammy gamifies the brainstorming process to make the blank slate be perceived by team members as a moment of opportunity to get whatever brilliant idea they might be thinking about out there.

Jammy was created over the course of five days for the 2022 [Google Computer Science Summer Institute](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/computer-science-summer-institute). We plan on pushing future updates to this repo.
